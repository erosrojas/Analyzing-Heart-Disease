# Analyzing-Heart-Disease

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death around the world, regardless of racial and ethnic groups. It refers to any condition that affects the structure or function of the heart. The most common type is coronary heart disease, caused by the narrowing of the arteries and leads to heart attacks and chest pains (anginas). Thus, prevention and accurate prediction of heart disease is a crucial scientific topic. In this project, we will answer the question: How accurately can we predict whether an individual suffers from heart disease or not given related health indicators?

The data was collected from 3 different countries (United States, Hungary, Switzerland), and was subsequently used to train a LASSO-regularized Logistic Regression model to predict the presence of heart disease. The model sensitivity was optimized primarily (to reduce false-negatives), which yielded a final accuracy of 76.9% and a  sensitivity of 97.5%.
